# Raise Flags

Rewrite Listing 15.13 using a thread to animate a flag being raised. Basically just rewriting the code 
of 15.13 to fit with a threading design.

## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

Well, I figured out the requirements of this program, by simply looking in the book or what I had to do which was
 look inside the pearson in the supplemental material section to find the 30.3 assignment
then reading the text that says I need to go back and rewrite an old set of code that i've previously seen
in chapter 15 in 15.13 Animate flag. Now it says I have basically rewrite the code in 15.13 using the new 
knowledge that i've learned in chapter 30 of threading.

### Design

How did you approach your program design? Did you use multiple classes to define various objects?

```
Give examples
```

### Testing

A step by step series of examples that you developed to properly test the program. 

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Notes

You can test the 15.13 and thew new rewritten code by setting the delay timer to 10 seconds
and compare.
